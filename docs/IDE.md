<h1 align="center">IDE</h1>

You can use IDE of your choice, but I recommend `PhpStorm` or `VSCode`, both perform very well.

For VSCode, the repository includes several settings that improve its operation with PHP, as well as recommended extensions that should appear in the Extensions tab, so you can download them right away.
